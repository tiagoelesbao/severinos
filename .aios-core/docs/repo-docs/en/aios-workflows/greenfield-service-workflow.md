## Summary

The **Greenfield Service Workflow** is designed for creating new backend services and APIs from scratch. It focuses on:

- API design and specification
- Service architecture patterns
- Database modeling
- Authentication and authorization
- API documentation (OpenAPI/Swagger)
- Testing strategies for services

### When to Use

- Building a new backend service or microservice
- Creating REST or GraphQL APIs
- Developing backend-only projects without frontend components

### Key Agents

- `@architect` - Service architecture and API design
- `@dev` - Backend implementation
- `@data-engineer` - Database schema design
- `@qa` - API testing and quality

### Main Phases

1. **API Design** - Contract-first API specification
2. **Architecture** - Service patterns and structure
3. **Data Layer** - Database design and migrations
4. **Implementation** - Service logic development
5. **Testing** - Integration and contract tests
