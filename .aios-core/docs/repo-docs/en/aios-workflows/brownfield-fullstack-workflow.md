## Summary

The **Brownfield Fullstack Workflow** is designed for evolving existing full-stack applications. It handles:

- Impact analysis across frontend and backend
- Coordinated changes between layers
- Backward compatibility considerations
- Migration strategies
- Regression prevention

### When to Use

- Adding features to existing full-stack applications
- Refactoring across multiple layers
- Major enhancements requiring frontend and backend changes
- After completing brownfield-discovery

### Prerequisites

- Run `brownfield-discovery` first if unfamiliar with the project
- Understand existing architecture and patterns

### Key Agents

- `@architect` - Change impact analysis
- `@dev` - Implementation across layers
- `@data-engineer` - Database migrations
- `@qa` - Regression testing

### Main Phases

1. **Impact Analysis** - Understanding affected areas
2. **Planning** - Coordinated change strategy
3. **Backend Changes** - API and service modifications
4. **Frontend Changes** - UI updates and integration
5. **Validation** - End-to-end testing
