## Summary

The **QA Loop Workflow** defines the quality assurance cycle within AIOS development. It ensures:

- Comprehensive test coverage
- Code quality standards
- Performance validation
- Security checks
- Accessibility compliance

### When to Use

- During the QA phase of story-development-cycle
- For dedicated quality review sessions
- Before release preparation

### Key Agents

- `@qa` - Primary quality assurance
- `@dev` - Bug fixes and improvements
- `@architect` - Architecture review

### Main Phases

1. **Test Planning** - Test strategy and coverage goals
2. **Automated Testing** - Unit, integration, E2E tests
3. **Manual Review** - Code review and exploratory testing
4. **Issue Tracking** - Bug identification and prioritization
5. **Resolution** - Fix implementation and verification

### Quality Gates

- All tests passing
- Linting and type checking clean
- Code coverage thresholds met
- No critical security issues
