## Summary

The **Story Development Cycle Workflow** is the core development process in AIOS. It orchestrates the complete lifecycle of implementing a user story:

- Story breakdown and task creation
- Test-first development approach
- Iterative implementation
- Code review and quality gates
- Documentation updates

### When to Use

- For every story implementation in AIOS
- Called by greenfield and brownfield workflows
- After spec-pipeline approval

### Key Agents

- `@po` - Story management
- `@dev` - Implementation
- `@qa` - Quality assurance
- `@devops` - Deployment

### Main Phases

1. **Preparation** - Story review and task breakdown
2. **Development** - Test-first implementation cycle
3. **Quality** - Code review and testing
4. **Integration** - Merge and deployment preparation
5. **Closure** - Story completion and documentation

### Execution Modes

- **YOLO** - Fully autonomous execution
- **Interactive** - Human checkpoints at key decisions
- **Pre-Flight** - Planning only, no execution
