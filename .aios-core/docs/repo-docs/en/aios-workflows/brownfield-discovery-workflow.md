## Summary

The **Brownfield Discovery Workflow** is the essential first step when working with existing projects. It provides systematic analysis of:

- Codebase structure and architecture
- Technology stack identification
- Dependency analysis
- Code quality assessment
- Documentation gaps
- Technical debt identification

### When to Use

- Starting work on an unfamiliar existing project
- Onboarding to a new codebase
- Auditing a project before major changes
- Understanding system architecture before evolution

### Key Agents

- `@analyst` - Research and analysis
- `@architect` - Architecture assessment
- `@dev` - Technical evaluation
- `@qa` - Quality analysis

### Main Phases

1. **Structure Analysis** - Directory and file organization
2. **Tech Stack** - Frameworks, libraries, and tools identification
3. **Architecture Mapping** - System design understanding
4. **Quality Assessment** - Code health and technical debt
5. **Documentation** - Generating discovery report

### Output

A comprehensive discovery document that enables informed decisions for subsequent brownfield workflows.
