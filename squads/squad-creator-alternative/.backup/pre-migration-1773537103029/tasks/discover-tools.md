# Task: Discover Tools for Squad

**Task ID:** discover-tools
**Execution Type:** Agent
**Purpose:** Research and discover MCP servers that can potentialize a squad's deliverables
**Orchestrator:** @squad-chief
**Mode:** Autonomous with human validation
**Quality Standard:** AIOX Level (comprehensive research, validated sources)
**Model:** `Opus` (multi-source research synthesis and prioritization)
**Haiku Eligible:** NO -- discovery quality depends on deep semantic evaluation

**Frameworks Used:**
- `data/quality-dimensions-framework.md` → Tool quality scoring
- `data/decision-heuristics-framework.md` → Tool selection logic
- `protocols/ai-first-governance.md` → Canonical scope validation + contradiction guard

> **Note:** This is the base version focused on MCP server discovery. For comprehensive multi-source discovery (APIs, CLIs, Libraries, GitHub Projects, Skills/Prompts), use squad-creator-pro `*discover-tools`.

---

## PRO DETECTION

> At execution time, check if `squads/squad-creator-pro/workflows/wf-discover-tools.yaml` exists.
> If YES and pro mode is active → delegate to pro workflow override.
> If NO → continue with this base version.
>
> Pro mode check: `squads/squad-creator-pro/squad.yaml` exists → pro_mode=true

---

## Overview

This task validates domain context, scans internal infrastructure, identifies capability gaps, and searches for MCP servers to fill those gaps. The base version focuses on the highest-value tool category (MCP servers) and produces a synthesized report.

**Philosophy:** "A squad should leverage available MCP tools to deliver maximum value with minimum user intervention."

**v3.0 Changes:**
- Simplified to MCP-focused discovery (base version)
- Removed API, CLI, GitHub, Library, and Skill discovery phases (moved to pro)
- Internal infrastructure scan uses existing squad structure instead of external library
- PRO DETECTION block for automatic delegation

```

## PHASE -2: DOMAIN CONTEXT VALIDATION (MANDATORY)

**Duration:** 2-6 minutes
**Checkpoint:** SC_DCV_001 (Domain Context Validation Gate)
**Mode:** Autonomous + Elicitation on ambiguity

### Step -2.1: Resolve Scope From Canonical Artifacts

**Actions:**
```yaml
scope_resolution:
  canonical_sources_priority:
    - "squads/{domain}/squad.yaml"
    - "squads/{domain}/squad.yaml"
    - "squads/{domain}/README.md"
    - "{registry_path}"
    - "related squad workflows/tasks/agents"

  rules:
    - "DO NOT infer scope from slug/name alone"
    - "Collect explicit domain/purpose/use-cases evidence"
    - "Mark unresolved or conflicting sources explicitly"
```

### Step -2.2: Build Canonical Evidence Pack

**Actions:**
```yaml
evidence_pack:
  required_fields:
    - source_path
    - extracted_scope_statement
    - status: "implemented|partial|concept"

  output:
    canonical_scope:
      declared_domain: ""
      declared_purpose: ""
      evidence: []
      contradictions: []
      confidence: "high|medium|low"
```

**Actions:**
```yaml
ambiguity_gate:
  pass_when:
    - "declared_domain is explicit"
    - "declared_purpose is explicit"
    - "no unresolved contradiction"

  fail_when:
    - "scope derived only from name/slug"
    - "canonical files missing/conflicting"
    - "confidence == low"

  on_fail:
    action: "HALT discovery and ask user clarification before external search"
```

**Output (PHASE -2):**
```yaml
phase_minus_2_output:
  scope_status: "verified|partial|unverified"
  canonical_scope:
    domain: ""
    purpose: ""
  evidence_paths: []
  contradictions_found: []
  requires_user_clarification: true/false
```

## PHASE -1: INTERNAL INFRASTRUCTURE DISCOVERY (MANDATORY)

**Duration:** 3-8 minutes
**Checkpoint:** SC_INT_001 (Internal Coverage Gate)
**Mode:** Autonomous

### Step -1.1: Scan Existing Squad Structure

**Actions:**
```yaml
internal_scan:
  scan_paths:
    - "squads/{domain}/squad.yaml"       # Squad configuration
    - "squads/{domain}/agents/"            # Existing agents
    - "squads/{domain}/tasks/"             # Existing tasks
    - "squads/{domain}/workflows/"         # Existing workflows
    - "squads/{domain}/data/"              # Existing data files

  extract:
    - declared_tools: "From squad.yaml tools section"
    - agent_capabilities: "From agent definitions"
    - task_dependencies: "From task dependency blocks"
    - workflow_integrations: "From workflow tool references"

  also_scan:
    - ".claude/settings.local.json"        # Configured MCP servers
    - ".claude/settings.json"              # Project MCP servers
```

### Step -1.2: Map Internal Coverage

**Actions:**
```yaml
internal_coverage_mapping:
  for_each_use_case:
    - derive_required_capabilities: true
      match_against: "existing agent/task/tool capabilities"

  output:
    covered_by_internal: []
    partially_covered_by_internal: []
    not_covered_by_internal: []
```

### Step -1.3: Define External Search Scope

**Actions:**
```yaml
external_scope_definition:
  rule: "Search external only for not_covered_by_internal OR justified enhancement"

  for_each_capability:
    if covered_by_internal:
      external_search: "skip"
      recommendation_policy: "internal_primary"
    if partially_covered_by_internal:
      external_search: "optional"
      recommendation_policy: "internal_primary + external_fallback"
    if not_covered_by_internal:
      external_search: "required"
      recommendation_policy: "external_primary_allowed"

phase_minus_1_output:
  internal_capabilities_found: 12
  covered_by_internal: 8
  partial_internal: 2
  external_only_gaps: 2
  external_search_scope:
    required: ["pdf_processing", "email_automation"]
    optional: ["benchmark_timing"]
```

## PHASE 0: CAPABILITY GAP ANALYSIS

**Duration:** 5-10 minutes
**Checkpoint:** None (fast analysis)
**Mode:** Autonomous

### Step 0.1: Map Required Capabilities

**Actions:**
```yaml
capability_mapping:
  for_each_use_case:
    - use_case: "{use_case}"
      ask:
        - "What INPUT does this use case need?"
        - "What PROCESSING does it require?"
        - "What OUTPUT should it produce?"
        - "What INTEGRATIONS would enhance it?"

      derive:
        input_capabilities:
          - "web_research"        # If needs external info
          - "file_reading"        # If needs local files
          - "user_input"          # If needs user data
          - "api_data"            # If needs external data

        processing_capabilities:
          - "text_analysis"       # NLP, sentiment, etc.
          - "data_transformation" # ETL, formatting
          - "code_generation"     # If creates code
          - "image_processing"    # If handles images

        output_capabilities:
          - "file_generation"     # Creates files
          - "api_calls"           # Sends to external services
          - "notifications"       # Alerts/messages
          - "reports"             # Structured reports

        enhancement_capabilities:
          - "automation"          # Reduces manual work
          - "quality_checks"      # Validates output
          - "integration"         # Connects to other tools
```

### Step 0.2: Check Existing Tool Coverage

**Actions:**
```yaml
coverage_analysis:
  loads:
    - "squads/{domain}/squad.yaml"       # Squad tools
    - ".claude/settings.local.json"       # Configured MCPs

  for_each_capability:
    - check: "capability_mapping.{capability}"
      find_tools: true

      result:
        covered_internal: ["internal_tool1"]
        partially_covered_internal: ["internal_tool2"]
        covered: ["tool1", "tool2"]
        partially_covered: ["tool3"]
        not_covered: true/false

  output:
    coverage_report:
      internal_fully_covered: []
      internal_partially_covered: []
      fully_covered: []
      partially_covered: []
      gaps: []  # Only external-only gaps go to MCP discovery
```

### Step 0.2b: Scan Local Skills & Squads

**Actions:**
```yaml
local_skills_scan:
  # 1. Scan project-level skills
  scan_path: ".claude/skills/*/SKILL.md"
  for_each_skill:
    extract:
      - name: "from frontmatter"
      - description: "from frontmatter"
      - capabilities: "inferred from description + body"
      - agent: "if skill delegates to specific agent"
      - tools_used: "allowed-tools from frontmatter"

    match_against: capability_requirements
    classify:
      - COVERS: "Skill directly solves this capability"
      - ADAPTABLE: "Skill partially covers, can be forked/extended"
      - UNRELATED: "No match"

  # 2. Scan squad capabilities
  scan_path: "squads/*/squad.yaml"
  for_each_squad:
    extract:
      - domain
      - agents: "names + specialties"
      - tasks: "names + purposes"
      - workflows: "names + purposes"
      - skills: "if embedded"

    match_against: capability_requirements
    classify:
      - REUSABLE: "Squad component directly applicable"
      - ADAPTABLE: "Component can be modified for this domain"
      - UNRELATED: "Different domain, no overlap"

  # 3. Scan global skills (user-level)
  scan_path: "~/.claude/skills/*/SKILL.md"
  same_extraction: true

  output:
    local_skills_coverage:
      skills_scanned: N
      squads_scanned: N
      covers:
        - capability: "web_research"
          covered_by:
            - { type: "skill", name: "tech-search", path: ".claude/skills/tech-search/SKILL.md" }
      adaptable:
        - capability: "competitor_analysis"
          adaptable_from:
            - { type: "squad", name: "spy", component: "deep-research task", effort: "low" }
      gaps: []  # Capabilities with NO skill/squad coverage
```

**Key Principle:** Skills are zero-cost and immediate.
A local skill that covers a capability should be preferred over adding external tool complexity.

### Step 0.3: Prioritize Gaps

**Actions:**
```yaml
gap_prioritization:
  for_each_gap:
    - capability: "{gap}"
      score:
        impact: 0-10  # How much value does filling this gap add?
        frequency: 0-10  # How often is this capability needed?
        user_dependency: 0-10  # How much does gap require user intervention?

      priority: (impact * 0.4) + (frequency * 0.3) + (user_dependency * 0.3)

  input_filter:
    only_include:
      - "not_covered_by_internal"
      - "partially_covered_by_internal_with_strong_justification"

  output:
    prioritized_gaps:
      - capability: "..."
        priority: 8.5
        search_queries: []
```

**Output (PHASE 0):**
```yaml
phase_0_output:
  total_capabilities_needed: 15
  already_covered: 8
  partially_covered: 3
  gaps_to_research: 4
  prioritized_gaps:
    - capability: "pdf_processing"
      priority: 9.2
    - capability: "email_automation"
      priority: 8.5
    - capability: "competitor_monitoring"
      priority: 7.8
```

github_mcp_search:
  queries:
    - query: "topic:mcp-server {domain}"
      type: "topic"
    - query: "mcp server {domain} in:readme"
      type: "code"
    - query: "model context protocol {use_case}"
      type: "repositories"

  filters:
    - stars: ">= 10"
    - updated: "within 6 months"
    - has_readme: true
    - has_license: true

  for_each_result:

**Actions:**
```yaml
mcp_scoring:
  criteria:
    official_source:
      weight: 0.30
      check: "Is from modelcontextprotocol or anthropic?"

    documentation:
      weight: 0.20
      check: "Has complete README?"

    maintenance:
      weight: 0.20
      check: "Updated in last 6 months?"

    community:
      weight: 0.15
      check: "Stars > 50? Active issues?"

    capability_match:
      weight: 0.15
      check: "Solves prioritized gap?"

  threshold: 6.0
  max_recommendations: 5
```

**Output (PHASE 1):**
```yaml
phase_1_output:
  mcps_found: 12
  mcps_qualified: 5
  top_recommendations:

      - integration_time: "hours/days"
      - cost: "$0/free | $X/month | enterprise"
      - learning_curve: "low | medium | high"
      - is_skill: true/false  # Skills get near-zero effort bonus

    roi_score: impact_score / effort_score

  quadrants:
    quick_wins: "High impact, low effort"
    strategic: "High impact, high effort"
    fill_ins: "Low impact, low effort"

## Integration with Squad Creation

### When to Execute

This task should be executed:

1. **During Squad Creation** - Phase 0.5 (after Discovery, before Architecture)
   ```yaml
   # In wf-create-squad.yaml
   - id: phase_0_5
     name: "TOOL DISCOVERY"
     task: "tasks/discover-tools.md"
     inputs:
       domain: "{domain}"
       use_cases: "{use_cases}"
   ```

2. **When Adding New Use Cases** - To find tools for new capabilities

3. **Periodically** - Monthly refresh to discover new MCP servers

### Task Dependencies

```yaml
depends_on:
  - "Phase 0: Discovery" # Need domain and use_cases

feeds_into:
  - "Phase 3: Creation" # Tools inform task design
  - "Phase 4: Integration" # Tools added to dependencies
```
