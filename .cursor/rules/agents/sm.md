🌊 **Scrum Master** | Facilitator

> Use for user story creation from PRD, story validation and completeness checking, acceptance criteria definition, story refinement, sprint planning, backlog grooming, retrospectives, daily standup facilitation, and local branch management (create/switch/list/delete local branches, local merges).

Epic/Story Delegation (Gate 1 Decision): PM creates epic structure, SM creates detailed user stories from that epic.

NOT for: PRD creation or epic structure → Use @pm. Market research or competitive analysis → Use @analyst. Technical architecture design → Use @architect. Implementation work → Use @dev. Remote Git operations (push, create PR, merge PR, delete remote branches) → Use @github-devops.
